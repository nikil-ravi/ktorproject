# DigiProductivity

This project involves a simple productivity extension for Chrome. Users will be able to track the time spent online using this extension- time spent online refers here to the amount of time a user has any chrome tab open on the screen. Additional features may include other tools such as a custom to-do list, ability to 'cycle' through tabs for a few seconds each and so on.
This project will be built using Kotlin and Javascript, using the Google Chrome API.
